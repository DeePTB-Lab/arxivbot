        "abstract": "Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy. These findings establish that modern uMLIPs are sufficiently robust to serve as zero-shot surrogates for high-throughput kinetic screening of next-generation energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Designing metal-semiconductor junctions is essential for optimizing the performance of modern nanoelectronic devices. A widely used material is TiSi$_2$, which combines low electronic resistivity with good endurance. However, its multitude of polymorphs continues to pose a challenge for device fabrication. In particular, the naturally occurring formation of the metastable C49-TiSi$_2$ modification remains poorly understood and is problematic due to its unfavorable electronic properties. Based on extensive DFT calculations, we present a comprehensive model of Ti adsorption on Si(100) that highlights the pivotal role of surface topology for the initial stages of the interfacial TiSi$_2$ formation process. We show that the interplay between Si surface dimers, the symmetry of the Si(100) surface, and the incorporation of Ti adsorbates below the surface drives an adsorption pattern that yields a nucleation template for the C49-TiSi$_2$ phase. Our atomistic model rationalizes experimental observations like the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, the preferential formation of C49-TiSi$_2$ despite it being less favorable than the competing C54 phase, and why disruption of the surface structure restores thermodynamically driven growth of the latter. Ultimately, this novel perspective on the unique growth of TiSi$_2$ will help to pave the way for next-generation electronic devices.",

        "introduction": "\n\nThe performance of modern micro- and optoelectronic devices hinges on reliable metal–semi\\-conductor contacts at nanometer scales. Among available contact materials, titanium disilicide () is widely used in Si-based architectures due to its low electrical resistivity, small Schottky barrier on n-type Si, and chemical stability. These properties have established \\ as an important material for CMOS technologies, Schottky diodes, and photodetectors, and have prompted exploration of its role in emerging applications, including photocatalytic water splitting and perovskite- tandem photovoltaics.\n\nYet, despite its technological ubiquity, the fabrication of phase-pure  remains a persistent challenge. Upon annealing, Ti deposited on crystalline Si forms a metastable orthorhombic C49 phase, which only transforms to the desired low-resistivity C54 polymorph at elevated temperatures. The persistent nucleation of C49- — even under conditions where C54 is thermodynamically favored — suggests a complex and poorly understood interplay of interfacial energetics, surface mobility, and local strain. The limitations of C49 not only degrades the electrical performance through increased contact resistance, but also impose stringent thermal budgets that constrain integration with temperature-sensitive materials in advanced device stacks, such as 3D architectures and backside power delivery networks. Understanding and ultimately controlling this phase selection is thus critical for enabling next-generation nanoscale logic and optoelectronic platforms.\n\nIn standard device processing, thin  layers are formed via self-aligned silicidation (salicidation), where Ti is deposited onto single-crystalline Si and subsequently annealed. Initial Ti growth follows a Stranski-Krastanov-like mode: after formation of a monolayer, additional adatoms cluster into three-dimensional islands. Notably, XPS measurements reveal the onset of silicide formation even at room temperature, suggesting immediate inte",

        "abstract": "Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \\textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $ρ$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \\textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.",

        "introduction": "Transition metal oxide octahedra with electronic configurational degeneracy are susceptible to a Jahn--Teller (JT) distortion~, causing their shape to deviate from that of a regular octahedron. \nSuch distortions most commonly manifest as a linear superposition of the $E_g(Q_2,Q_3)$ van Vleck modes~, where $Q_2$ and $Q_3$ are planar rhombic and tetragonal distortions, respectively, although the tetragonal $Q_3$ component tends to dominate. \nJT distortions have been observed in both molecules~ and crystals~. \nThe JT distortion, and associated orbital ordering, is relevant to many phenomena including superconductivity in the cuprates~, spin-orbit ordering~, and ionic mobility~, and can lead to structural transitions on cycling in battery electrode materials~. \n\nWithin solids, the axes of octahedral elongation can correlate  orbital ordering over macroscopic length-scales as a cooperative JT (cJT) distortion, typically manifesting as a reduction in unit cell symmetry~. \nFor instance, the perovskites KF$_3$ (=Cr,Cu)~, LaMnO$_3$~, and [(CH$_3$)$_2$NH$_2$]Cu(HCOO)$_3$~ exhibit a cJT distortion with alternating O$_6$ (=Cu,Cr,V,Mn) octahedra elongated along two orthogonal directions within the $xy$-plane, as shown in Figure~(a). \nThis ordering is generally stacked identically along the $c$-direction~. \nInterestingly, similar orbital ordering driven by $t_{2g}$ orbitals is seen in the vanadate perovskites VO$_3$ (=Ho,La,Y)~, although on cooling to low temperatures, some (such as LaVO$_3$ and YVO$_3$) have been shown to exhibit out-of-phase stacking along the $c$-direction~ [SI Figure~]. \nThe flexibility of the perovskite structure means that other kinds of ordering can also be exhibited; Ba$_{0.5}$La$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$ exhibits a collinear elongational cJT ordering of the CoO$_6$ octahedra when the La/Ba is disordered~ but a compressive collinear ordering when the La/Ba is ordered~ [Figure~]. \n\n[t]\n    [scale=1]{ordering-from-literature.pdf}\n     \n    {\n        \n        The room-",

        "introduction": "\n\nThe Faraday effect is one of the most prominent magneto-optical phenomena, characterized by the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it propagates through a magnetized medium~. Its counterpart, the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), refers to the generation of magnetization in a material in response to circularly polarized light and has been both theoretically predicted~ and experimentally confirmed~. Similarly, another form of light-induced magnetization is known as the inverse Cotton--Mouton effect, in which linearly polarized light generates magnetization; this effect has also been theoretically predicted~ and experimentally verified~. These phenomena have attracted considerable attention as mechanisms for the optical manipulation of magnetic order, or, more broadly, for imprinting information onto quantum states using light~.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of quantum states is their quantum geometry~. The Berry curvature~, which corresponds to the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor~, is known to play a pivotal role in phenomena such as the anomalous velocity of electron wave-packets~ and the properties of topological materials. The real part of the quantum geometric tensor is known as the quantum metric. Recent studies have shown that the quantum metric contributes to Hall viscosity~, the Drude weight~, and the superfluid weight~. Moreover, the dipole moments of the Berry curvature (Berry curvature dipole) and the quantum metric (quantum metric dipole) are known to give rise to nonlinear Hall effects~. In addition to transport phenomena, quantum geometry also manifests itself in nonlinear optical responses. A paradigmatic example is the bulk photovoltaic effect~, in which a dc photocurrent is generated as a second-order response to the electric field, and the corresponding nonlinear conductivity can be expressed in terms of geometric quantities~.

        "conclusion": "\n\nIn this work, we have developed a general theory of light-induced magnetization in electronic systems originating from quantum-geometric effects. By considering spatially nonuniform electric fields within a semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport equation, we established a unified formalism in which the magnetization arises as a second-order response to the electric field.\n\nWe identified two distinct quantum-geometric contributions to the magnetization: the quantum metric quadrupole and weighted quantum metric. While the former has been previously discussed in the context of transport currents under nonuniform electric field, the latter originates from perturbations to the Bloch states and does not appear in conventional transport currents. Our results demonstrate that both contributions are essential for a complete description of light-induced magnetization and that they naturally give rise to responses under both LPL and CPL. These effects correspond to the inverse Cotton--Mouton and the inverse Faraday effects, respectively.\n\nWe further analyzed symmetry constraints in two-dimensional systems and clarified the conditions under which responses to LPL and CPL are allowed. Using both a continuum massive Dirac model with anisotropic quadratic corrections and a tight-binding model on the hexagonal lattice, we explicitly demonstrated the emergence of nonvanishing magnetization responses when either mirror or rotational symmetries are broken. In particular, the tight-binding model of anisotropic gapped graphene allowed us to estimate the magnitude of the effect and showed that the induced magnetization is experimentally observable, although it may not constitute the dominant contribution to the overall inverse Faraday and inverse Cotton--Mouton effects.\n\nOur work establishes optically generated magnetization as a direct and experimentally accessible manifestation of quantum geometry in solids.

We address this challenge by training a machine learning model consisting of an autoencoder to standardize the spectra and a transformer model to predict both Cu oxidation state and Bader charge directly from L-edge spectra. The model is trained on a large dataset of FEFF-simulated spectra and evaluates model performance on both simulated and experimental data.

        "introduction": "Molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) provide a compact way of describing how a molecule interacts electrostatically with its environment. MEPs have long been used to rationalize sites of electrophilic and nucleophilic attack, hydrogen bonding patterns, molecular recognition, (electro)catalytic reactivity and solvent design~. Nevertheless, one rarely works directly with continuous MEPs in practical molecular  simulations. Instead, the potential is represented in terms of a set of atomic charges that are tuned to reproduce the  electrostatic potential (ESP) around the molecule as faithfully as possible~.\n\nThis idea gave rise to the “ESP-charge” family of methods, in which atom-centered monopoles are obtained by fitting the quantum-chemical MEP on a grid of points surrounding the molecule. Well-known examples include the Merz–Kollman scheme~, CHELP/CHELPG~, and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model~. These methods differ mainly in how the grid points are chosen, how rotational invariance and numerical stability are enforced, and how regularization or restraints are applied to avoid unphysical charges for highly buried atoms.\n\nOne such regularization is to supplement the ESP fit with constraints that enforce the correct multipole moments~. This improves the description of the far-field electrostatics and helps stabilize the fit for flexible or highly polar molecules. A different but related avenue is exemplified by charge model 5 (CM5)~, which starts from Hirshfeld population analysis and then maps the resulting atomic charges through element- and environment-specific corrections that are parametrized to reproduce gas-phase dipole moments across a large and diverse training set.\n\nIn parallel with these developments, atomistic machine-learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a powerful way to construct environment-dependent charge models.
