Using a tight-binding model, we carried out a detailed analytical analysis of the electronic band structures for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. We show that their low energy band dispersions near the Fermi level may be deduced from its substacks in isolation. The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. Moreover, we find that an interplay of parallel and rhombohedral stackings allows for flat band engineering and enhancement in arbitrarily stacked MLGs. The existence of flat bands in MLGs might offer another interesting platform for exploring the superconductivity in graphene systems beyond the twisted bilayer graphene.",

        "introduction": "The electronic properties of multilayer graphene are fundamentally determined by its stacking geometry, which controls the band structure near the Fermi level. While single layer graphene features massless Dirac fermions with a linear dispersion , multilayer graphene systems exhibit dramatically different behaviors depending on their stacking order and layer number. Early theoretical and experimental studies established that Bernal (AB), rhombohedral (ABC), and parallel (AA) stackings each produce distinct electronic structures . Moreover, the nature of charge carriers in few-layer graphene is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and the stacking geometry, making the possibility of analyzing a general arbitrary multilayer stack challenging. Rhombohedral stacking is particularly notable for generating flat bands at low energies, characterized by vanishing Fermi velocity and enhanced density of states. These flat bands play a central role in promoting strong electron-electron correlations and have become a key ingredient for realizing exotic quantum phases including superconductivity .\n\nThe discovery of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has generated intense interest in flat band engineering as a route to unconventional superconductivity . When graphene layers are twisted at specific magic angles (the first  being $  1.1$), moir\\'e superlattices form with isolated flat bands that support Mott insulating states and superconducting domes reminiscent of high-$T_c$ cuprates. This paradigm has been extended to multilayer systems; for example, magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene ($N$ = 3, 4, 5 layers) forms a robust family of moir\\'e superconductors, revealing that flat bands are a common feature but with important variations between even and odd layer numbers . Moreover, gate-tunable  superconductivity in ABC-trilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride systems have been observed, showing Mott insulating states and superconducting domes th",
        "conclusion": "\n\nWe have studied the electronic properties of graphene by considering the properties of the special cases of graphene stacking, AA, AB, and ABC, and applying them to a general, arbitrarily stacked multilayer graphene. We observe a remarkable level of correspondence when we incorporate these stacks together in an arbitrary fashion. Specifically, in studying stacking faults we observed that the embedding of an ABC stack could generate a flat band that very much resembles the sole ABC stack's flat band. The possibility to induce these flat bands which generate correlated electrons while also maintaining linear bands which generate massless Dirac fermions has also been discussed. Moreover, we saw that an embedding of an AA stack allowed us to analytically solve the momenta for which there is an energy eigenvalue of zero. This then allowed us to make a more general statement about the zero energy momenta for arbitrary stacking. The existence of these properties suggests the possibility for a more general consideration of arbitrary stacking. In general, such arbitrary stacking could contain a multitude of parallel, Bernal, and rhombohedral stacking for which one could attempt to predict the properties thereof. We have done so for the momenta for which the energy eigenvalue is zero, which we have found out is in direct relation to the existence of AA substacks; it is therefore plausible that more properties could be associated with the existence of other types of substacks. A primitive method which is what we have shown to be successful in many situations would be to decompose the graphene stack in a well defined manner and considering the decomposition's properties to then predict that of the arbitrary stack; it is qualitatively accurate for the detection of flat bands, and quantitatively accurate for finding the rings of zero energy. These calculations furthermore show the ability to extend the flat band of graphene, which is promising for enhancing its many notable pro",

        "abstract": "Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

        "introduction": "Pearlite, formed through the eutectoid transformation of austenite, ranks among the decisive technological microstructures in steel. It is composed of the soft and ductile body-centered cubic ferrite ($$, space group $Im3m$) and the rigid orthorhombic cementite ($\n$, space group $Pnma$) phase. The morphology of pearlite, which is highly influenced by its thermal history, is typically lamellar in a majority of industrial applications. The thickness of these lamellae plays a crucial role in adjusting the steels' strength and ductility, as described by the Hall-Petch relation~. Another critical factor influencing the mechanical properties of pearlitic steels is their chemical composition. Here, most of the literature focuses on the effect of alloying elements on the prior austenite grain size~, their impact on the eutectoid transformation point~, and  diffusion~, which influence the size of the pearlite colonies and lamella fineness~. For instance,  decreases the lamellae spacing by elevating the equilibrium eutectoid transformation temperature, which enables greater undercooling, and also by lowering the  diffusion coefficient in austenite~. According to~, elements such as  and , which stabilize ferrite and form carbides, generally lessen the spacing of lamellae, whereas those that stabilize austenite typically enlarge it. Alloying elements may also influence the lamellae's appearance.

        "abstract": "Recent experiments in moiré quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moiré-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon.

Most existing approaches learn a direct map from molecular geometries, typically represented as graphs or encoded local environments, to molecular properties or use ML as a surrogate for electronic structure theory by targeting quantities such as Fock or density matrices expressed in an atomic orbital (AO) basis.   Inspired by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, in this work, we propose an operator-centered framework in which the external (nuclear) potential, expressed in an AO basis, serves as the model input. From this operator, we construct hierarchical, body-ordered representations of atomic configurations that closely mirror the principles underlying several popular atom-centered descriptors. At the same time, the matrix-valued nature of the external potential provides a natural connection to equivariant message-passing neural networks. In particular, we show that successive products of the external potential provide a scalable route to equivariant message passing and enable an efficient description of long-range effects. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to model molecular properties, such as energies and dipole moments, from the external potential, or learn effective operator-to-operator maps, including mappings to the Fock matrix and the reduced density matrix from which multiple molecular observables can be simultaneously derived.",

        "abstract": "Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries.

In domains such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), data exhibits specific symmetries—for instance, objects in images possess translation invariance, while semantic meaning in text relies on sequential order. \nRecent diffusion~ and flow-based~ generative models have achieved great success across images~, videos~, text~, and biomolecules~. \nCrucially, however, modalities like images are not fully invariant to all transformations: an upside-down landscape or a reversed sentence typically loses its semantic validity. Consequently, state-of-the-art diffusion models in these fields explicitly break symmetries: they utilize fixed grid topologies or inject positional encodings (PEs) to anchor the generation process to a canonical orientation.\n\nIn contrast, molecular generation operates on a fundamentally different geometric space defined by the direct product of permutation and Euclidean symmetries, $S_N  SE(3)$. Unlike natural images, a rotated molecule or a re-indexed molecular graph represents the exact same physical entity.\nMolecular generative models typically enforce the constraints by building equivariant architectures and/or invariant priors~, so that the learned vector field (score/velocity) respects the group action and the generated distribution is symmetry-consistent. While principled, this approach often incurs substantial architectural and computational overhead (e.g., equivariant layers, tensor algebra), and it can obscure an additional challenge: symmetry creates latent “gauge” ambiguity, so intermediate noisy states may correspond to multiple equivalent group-transformed configurations.

The remaining within-slice  difficulty can be mitigated by better aligned priors and near-Monge couplings during training. Together, these results clarify when and why canonicalization and OT act complementarily, how to avoid projection- or conditioning-induced mismatches, and how to design practical, scalable symmetry-aware generators for molecules that improve few-step quality while preserving invariance by construction.

Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\\mathrm{Ca}_x\\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($χ^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $χ^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$χ^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.",

Here, we present a combined first-principles and finite-temperature study of magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ with different stacking configurations. Using density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ in $AA$, $AB$, and $BA$ stackings. The electronic structure exhibits a spin-polarized ground state dominated by Sc-$d$ states near the Fermi level. Mapping total energies onto an effective Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian reveals strong intralayer ferromagnetic exchange that is largely insensitive to stacking, while the inter-layer exchange depends strongly on stacking geometry, favoring ferromagnetic coupling for $AA$ and $BA$ stackings and antiferromagnetic coupling for the $AB$ stacking. Spin-orbit coupling calculations show that both monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ possess a robust out-of-plane magnetic easy axis. Finite-temperature Monte Carlo simulations indicate that all bilayer configurations sustain magnetic ordering at and above room temperature, with ordering temperatures in the range $360-375$ K, as confirmed by Binder cumulant analysis and finite-size scaling. These results demonstrate that stacking geometry enables control of the magnetic ground state in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ without significantly affecting its thermal stability.",

Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the Néel vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence.

Crystals are inherently periodic, with geometry defined on a three-dimensional torus and constrained by crystallographic symmetries , while many practically relevant materials exhibit variable atomic multiplicities and stoichiometries.

        "abstract": "Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.",

This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent \"steering\" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated.

        "introduction": "For nearly a century, our understanding of magnetic order was built upon a fundamental binary: ferromagnetism (FM), characterized by parallel spin alignment and a net macroscopic magnetization, and antiferromagnetism (AFM), where antiparallel spins cancel each other out, resulting in a zero net magnetic moment. As noted in a recent editorial by Igor Mazin , altermagnetism (AM)  has emerged as a ``new punch line'' (a third branch) in fundamental magnetism, disrupting this traditional dichotomy by introducing a third magnetic phase that combines the most desirable properties of both worlds.\n\n\nThe formalization of AM as a distinct phase was established in the seminal work by mejkal, Sinova, and Jungwirth . This theoretical framework has mapped out an extensive ``research landscape'' , identifying numerous candidate materials across metals, insulators, and semiconductors. They demonstrated that certain collinear magnets possess a unique symmetry where opposite magnetic sublattices are connected by crystal rotations rather than the translations or inversions typical of conventional AFMs. This ``nonrelativistic spin and crystal rotation symmetry'' results in a vanishing net magnetization (like an AFM) but allows for large, momentum-dependent spin splitting in the electronic bands (like a FM), even without considering spin-orbit coupling.\n\nIndeed, the most striking signature of an AM is the  Kramers spin degeneracy lifting in momentum space, experimentally confirmed in  . Traditional AFMs maintain degenerate spin-up and spin-down bands due to the combination of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, whereas AMs break this degeneracy. In colloquial terms, spin polarization is the ``secret sauce''. The significance of AM lies in its potential for spintronics. The spin polarization in AMs is not a weak effect because it is protected by the crystal lattice symmetry. Spin polarization allows the material to behave like an FM in transport experiments while acting like an AFM in t",

        "abstract": "A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or σ-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles.

We introduce mimyria, a modular and automated framework that orchestrates electronic-structure reference calculations, trains atom-resolved machine-learning response models, and generates IR and Raman spectra from MD trajectories within a unified workflow. We introduce the polarizability gradient tensor (PGT) as a novel atom-resolved machine-learning target property for Raman spectroscopy, complementing the established atomic polar tensor (APT) for IR spectroscopy. As a necessary prerequisite, we demonstrate how both PGTs and APTs can accurately be computed from electronic-structure theory, validate them across formally equivalent derivative formulations, and thereby benchmark their numerical consistency. We then employ machine learning as an efficient surrogate to represent the validated APT and PGT response functions on aqueous benchmark systems. We validate the trained models directly at the level of the spectrum against explicit ab initio reference calculations and find that IR and Raman spectra converge with surprisingly small training sets. Moreover, spectral agreement improves more rapidly than the root-mean-square error (RMSE). While RMSE is straightforward to compute, statistically converged reference spectra are generally impractical to obtain, motivating the need to relate model-level errors to observable-level accuracy. By connecting these complementary error measures, we provide practical guidelines and early-stopping criteria for achieving sufficient spectral fidelity. By integrating response-tensor learning, automated training, and spectral-domain validation into a unified workflow, mimyria enables data-efficient and quantitatively reliable vibrational spectroscopy.",

Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions.

Using zeolite-based SWCNTs prepared by alcohol CVD, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, together with two-dimensional excitation-emission fitting was employed to quantify chirality-specific growth efficiency. Two distinct growth regimes were identified. At a relatively low temperature of 600 C, pure Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity, promoting efficient growth of small-diameter (0.7-0.9 nm) SWCNTs. In contrast, at 850 C, the Fe0.75Co0.25 alloy shows a pronounced enhancement in growth efficiency compared with pure Fe, pure Co, and other Fe-Co compositions, also yielding larger diameter tubes (0.9-1.1nm). Similar growth behavior was observed on SiO2 substrates, enabling detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of catalyst nanoparticles. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that high SWCNT yields correlate with the formation of small, uniform Fe-Co nanoparticles with Co-enriched surfaces, in excellent agreement with MD simulations. Lastly, MD results are summarized in a composition-diameter phase diagram that rationalizes the experimentally observed growth trends. The exceptional performance of the Fe0.75Co0.25 catalyst at high temperature is attributed to the stabilization of small and uniform catalyst clusters, providing mechanistic insight into the synergistic roles of alloy composition and temperature in SWCNT growth.",

We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations.

        "abstract": "Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.",

These phenomena are intrinsically connected to the emergence of very flat bands due to the moiré potential , induced by the lattice mismatch created by the twist or strain . The quenching of the kinetic energy in the flat bands promotes the appearance of the observed electronic correlations. Any approach to understand the nature of the correlated phases in TBG must then start from a solid understanding of the nature and origin of the flat bands, supported by accurate modelling methods. \n\nWith only a relative twist, the flat bands are well-known to arise at an infinite set of , the largest one being around $1^{}$~. However, in practice the samples usually have at least some residual strain~, defects~ or even twist angle disorders~, typically arising during their fabrication~. The presence of strains, in particular, can significantly modify the geometrical and electronic properties of the system since the moiré acts as a magnifying glass~. Although this may be seen as undesirable, one can conversely use strains as an additional tune parameter in the system~. Compared to the twist, which only rotates the layers, strains distort the layers and thus can lead to a plethora of moiré patterns with potentially rich properties~. This has motivated recent experimental advances in developing new techniques to induce and manipulate the strain in moiré heterostructures~, opening a path to straintronics and twistronics, whereby the electronic properties can be tuned by the combined interplay between twist and strain.

Strain reshapes the moiré geometry, broadens the narrow bands, splits the vHs, lifts valley degeneracy, and shifts the Dirac points within the mBZ. The shear strain introduces stronger distortion of both the geometrical and electronic properties. Moreover, the strain direction is crucial: it controls both the bandwidth and the valley-resolved topology, and shifts the twist angle that minimizes the bandwidth.  A continuum model with strain-induced scalar and gauge fields reproduces the atomistic spectra and the strain-driven topological transitions that occur when the gap to the remote bands closes and reopens. Including electrostatic (Hartree) interactions, we find nonrigid spectral shifts at low strain that evolve toward an almost rigid shift at higher strain; the interaction mainly reshapes the bands without reversing the strain-induced broadening. Finally, we develop a general method based on the energy minimization, to determine the twist and strain from the STM topography.

Density-functional theory (DFT) lends itself optimally to this task. Besides the energy and wavefunction of atomic systems, it can also return their Hamiltonian matrix . This quantity can then be passed to a quantum transport (QT) solver to compute the ``current vs. voltage'' characteristics of the targeted device. In structures with atomic disorder such as the amorphous oxides used at the switching layer of resistive random access memories (ReRAM), the construction of  can be tedious. Large unit cells containing thousands of atoms are required to accurately represent ReRAM geometries. As DFT scales with $O(N^{3})$, $N$ being the number of atoms, it becomes prohibitively expensive at these scales, limiting the size of the devices that can be investigated at the  level.\n\nIn this work, we present an approach that overcomes this bottleneck by replacing DFT-computed Hamiltonians with machine-learned (ML) ones. We demonstrate this approach by simulating a valence change memory (VCM) cell, a ReRAM type with applications in neuromorphic computing . The VCM of interest is made of a TiN- HfO$_2$- Ti/TiN stack and 5,268 atoms. Its conductance can be modulated by applying an external voltage, which leads to the generation/recombination of oxygen vacancies at the Ti-HfO$_2$ interface and the formation/dissolution of conductive filaments. From a modeling perspective, the underlying structural evolution can be tracked with, for example, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)  or molecular dynamics (MD)  simulations. To compute the corresponding ``I-V'' characteristics, the Hamiltonian matrix of samples extracted at regular time intervals should be produced with DFT and passed as input to a QT solver. Bypassing the DFT step with ML requires a model that can learn complex features, e.g., non-regular lattices, the infl",
        "conclusion": "We presented an ML-based approach that can be integrated into a large-scale device simulation platform capable of computing from first-principles the ``I-V'' characteristics of atomic structures changing with time. Our model  not only bypasses computationally intensive DFT calculations, it can potentially also be used to construct the Hamiltonian matrix of systems with sizes beyond current DFT capabilities. Future work includes improving the prediction accuracy of our framework by incorporating more  training data and adopting more expressive network architectures. Other applications such as phase-change memories can be envisioned. They undergo gradual amorphous-to-crystalline transitions whose electronic properties could be predicted with ML instead of being computed with DFT .",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen uptake in brownmillerite perovskites A2B2O5 offers an (electro)chemically accessible route to tune functional properties, but mechanistic understanding and design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides remain limited. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation. Together, these results establish practical design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides relevant to iono-electronic devices, sensors, and electrically tunable spin functionality.",

Rare-earth (lanthanide) ions play a central role in upconversion materials due to their partially filled electronic shells $4f$, which give rise to ladder-like energy level structures with long-lived metastable states that enable efficient stepwise excitation under low optical intensities . Among these ions, Er$^{3+}$- and Yb$^{3+}$-doped systems are particularly prominent because of favorable energy-level matching and efficient energy transfer pathways . The efficiency of upconversion is strongly influenced by the host lattice, with low-phonon energy fluoride materials such as CaF$_2$ suppressing nonradiative relaxation and providing a chemically compatible environment for rare-earth substitution . These properties have generated extensive interest in rare-earth upconversion materials for applications ranging from solid-state lasers to photovoltaics, bioimaging, and emerging photonic and quantum technologies .\n\n\nDespite the widespread use of rare-earth upconversion materials, a quantitative first-principles description of upconversion processes remains challenging.

In comparison, QNN classifiers, such as SamplerQNNs and scalable QNN (SQNN) architectures, consistently attained higher test accuracies (95–97.5\\\n\nThese findings underscore a trend: QNNs, due to their trainable variational layers and embedded inductive biases (e.g., unitary constraints, convolutional invariance), surpass QSVMs in both flexibility and predictive performance, especially when dealing with small or structured datasets typical of physical sciences.

Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-Å all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\\% under loose and 33.4\\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows.",

        "conclusion": "In this work, we introduced GeoOpt-Net, a multi-scale SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement framework that bridges inexpensive conformer generation and high-level DFT accuracy at B3LYP/TZVP level of theory. From a methodological perspective, existing approaches for generating DFT-ready structures span several distinct paradigms, including classical conformer generators based on distance geometry and force fields, semiempirical quantum methods, data-driven geometry refinement pipelines, and machine-learning interatomic potentials. GeoOpt-Net belongs to the data-driven refinement category but differs fundamentally from existing approaches by explicitly decoupling bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral torsions into dedicated equivariant graph streams, which are fused through a lightweight Transformer decoder to capture chemically meaningful local coordination and long-range torsional couplings. This architecture is further combined with a two-stage training strategy, in which broadly transferable geometric representations are first learned by large-scale pretraining and subsequently fine-tuned to higher levels of theory, enabling systematic correction of basis-set- and element-dependent geometric deviations.\n\nComprehensive benchmarks against RDKit~, xTB~, Auto3D~, and UMA~ using B3LYP/TZVP reference data demonstrate that GeoOpt-Net produces near-DFT-quality geometries in a single forward pass, achieving sub-milli all-atom RMSD and tightly concentrated single-point energy deviations. Ablation experiments further confirm that explicit SE(3) equivariance and spectral graph encodings are indispensable for controlling error growth. Error decomposition reveals that the dominant performance gains arise from substantially improved torsional accuracy, with dihedral errors reduced by one to two orders of magnitude. This distinction directly reflects methodological differences: classical and semiempirical approaches are limited by approximate energy models, while potential-base",

        "abstract": "Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.",

We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region. Crucially, the model accurately reproduces the fidelity susceptibility and identifies the quantum phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical point.

These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.",

Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage.

While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability.

ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \\times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times.

We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter.

        "introduction": "Classical molecular dynamics simulations cannot study photochemical reactions because the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is no longer applicable in these cases. Fully quantum treatment on both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom is too computationally expensive for realistic molecular systems, if not impossible. Mixed quantum classical molecular dynamics (MQC-MD) method, including Ehrenfest mean-field (EMF), surface hopping and ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS), provides a powerful tool to chemists. One of the most popular MQC-MD algorithms is the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) developed by Tully in 1990. During FSSH dynamic simulations, the nuclei move classically on an adiabatic potential energy surface (PES) with a certain probability of jumping to any other state. The transition probability is obtained based on the time evolution of electron density matrix, which incorporates quantum feedback of electronic motion. Despite its simple implementation and great success in many applications, the computational expense of FSSH remains much higher than that of ground-state MD. Not only the potential energies and gradients for all relevant electronic states but also the nonadiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs) between different states should be calculated at a high level of electronic structure theory in each time step. Furthermore, FSSH requires an ensemble of trajectories to estimate collective results such as the excited-state lifetime and product yield. Strictly speaking, a dozen FSSH trajectories make little sense for revealing any mechanism of medium-sized or larger polyatomic molecules.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating machine learning (ML) techniques with MQC-MD for accelerating nonadiabatic dynamic simulations. ML has demonstrated its strong capability of fitting potential energy surfaces of high-dimensional molecules, either in the ground or excited state. However, accurate predictions of NACVs are much more difficu",

Here, we introduce ChemXDyn, a dynamics-aware computational methodology that leverages time-resolved interatomic distance signatures as a core principle to robustly identify chemically consistent bonded interactions and, consequently, extract meaningful reaction pathways. In particular, ChemXDyn propagates molecular connectivity through time while enforcing atomic valence and coordination constraints to distinguish genuine bond-breaking and bond-forming events from transient, nonreactive encounters.

        "abstract": "Transition states (TSs) govern the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions, making their accurate prediction a central challenge in computational chemistry. Although recent machine-learning models achieve near chemical accuracy in the prediction of TS structures and the associated reaction barriers for small organic reactions, their ability to generalize beyond the training domain remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce targeted benchmarks to probe chemical and structural novelty in generative TS prediction. Building on Transition1x, a large-scale dataset of reactions involving small organic molecules, we construct curated extensions incorporating controlled elemental substitutions and diverse transition-metal complexes (TMC). These benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations of generative models in the generalization to previously unseen elements. As a result, they produce unphysical geometries and large energetic errors, even for reactions structurally similar to well-predicted organic systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on equilibrium conformers that exposes generative TS models to novel chemical environments prior to targeted fine-tuning. Across the newly proposed benchmarks, self-supervised pretraining substantially improves TS prediction for previously unseen systems, lowering the median RMSD of TS geometries on T1x-TMC reactions from 0.39 to 0.19 $\\mathring{A}$ and reducing fine-tuning data requirements by up to 75%, enabling reliable performance even in low-data regimes. Overall, the integration of generative TS models with self-supervised pseudo-reaction pretraining provides an efficient, scalable, and chemically robust framework for elucidating TSs well beyond the small organic molecule domain, establishing a foundation for investigating complex and catalytically relevant reaction landscapes.",

Our scheme reveals that Ef is jointly determined by the average d-band center of RHEAs and the d-band width of interstitial sites. Notably, the d-band width mainly depends on the interatomic hopping matrix and atomic size-determined coordination number, which together make the metallic bonding around interstitials in RHEAs resemble the distance-dependence law of van der Waals forces.

        "abstract": "Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \\textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \\ce{Ti}, \\ce{Zr}, and \\ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \\ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength.

        "introduction": "The challenges associated with developing, manipulating, and understanding nanoscale atomistic systems have drawn significant attention from the research community due to fast advances in nanoscience. In the subnanometer regime, where quantum size effects become dominant, the nanostructures made of a few tens to several hundred atoms often show properties that differ from those of their bulk crystalline counterparts. This emergent behavior enables the materials design with tunable structural and electronic features, offering many opportunities in the energy conversion, optoelectronic, and catalytic fields. Transition metal (TM) nanoclusters (NCs) stand out in this context because of their distinct chemical reactivity, discrete electronic states, and high surface/volume ratios. The intrinsic fluxionality, finite size, and lack of translational symmetry characteristics result in a broad configurational landscape with many non-equivalent adsorption sites. As a result, TM-NCs exhibit a complex, yet highly adaptable catalytic behavior, which is particularly important in real-world scenarios (realistic environmental conditions) where toxic poisoning species and/or competing reaction pathways may be present.\n\nThe catalytic deactivation caused by -containing species is a long-standing dilemma in heterogeneous catalysis. This challenge arises because sulfur atoms and sulfur-bearing molecules, such as , , and , show strong affinity for metal active sites, frequently leading to partial or complete catalytic activity loss. Although adsorption mechanisms on extended surfaces are reasonably well disseminated/understood, the behavior of  adsorption on subnanometer clusters remains far less explored. This knowledge gap is mainly due to pronounced finite-size effects, enhanced fluxionality, and the low coordination of surface atoms in TM-NCs.

However, practical catalysis studies are rarely reducible to single calculations. Even standard tasks such as determining surface energies or screening descriptors often require orchestrating multi-step workflows: selecting bulk references, constructing and relaxing slabs under consistent constraints, enumerating adsorption sites, and managing job submission queues.\n\nWhile the community has developed robust libraries for atomistic simulations (e.g., ASE, pymatgen) and workflow managers for job orchestration, a significant operational gap around the practical use of these libraries persists. Consequently, researchers still frequently rely on manual intervention to chain disparate tools, convert data formats, and track intermediate structures.

We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings.

        "introduction": "Recently, significant attention has been given to anomalous Hall effects in graphene and other two-dimensional materials , . Unlike the conventional Hall effect, which requires an external magnetic field, these effects arise from the non-zero Berry curvature (BC) of the electronic bands, which acts as an effective magnetic field in momentum space . Two types of anomalous Hall responses are linked to non-zero Berry curvature: linear and nonlinear responses. The linear anomalous Hall current is proportional to the Berry curvature, whereas the nonlinear effect is linked to the presence of a non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole (BCD) . In 2021, both linear and nonlinear Hall effect currents were observed in corrugated bilayer graphene , whereas previously such responses had only been observed in the Weyl semi-metal WTe$_2$ . While the BCD in pristine bilayer graphene vanishes, the nonlinear Hall effect can emerge when inversion symmetry is broken and the Dirac cones are tilted by corrugation or strain.\n\nThe anomalous Hall effect can be studied theoretically through simulations of the full electrical response, but such approaches are computationally intensive. A more amenable approach for homogeneous systems is to relate the BC and the BCD to the properties of the Bloch wave functions in k-space. These can be obtained by direct diagonalization of the system's Hamiltonian. Previous work, such as Ref. , found that a non-vanishing BCD appears in uniaxially strained bilayer graphene as a consequence of Fermi surface warping. In that work, the BC and BCD were calculated using an effective low-energy continuum Hamiltonian, in which strain effects enters as an strain-induced gauge potential.\n\nA different approach based on a tight-binding (TB) model can be used to calculate the energy dispersion and wave functions of the material. Importantly, the TB model of bilayer graphene offers some advantages over continuum models, especially when it comes to studying the effects of lattic",
        "conclusion": "The BCD in strained bilayer graphene proves sensitive to details of the electronic structure that are often treated as secondary. Our TB calculations reveal that the choice between  bilayer graphene versus bulk graphite parameters leads to qualitatively different predictions for the BCD as a function of doping, particularly sign changes that occur at experimentally accessible carrier densities. We find that this difference arises from the $_4$ skew hopping, which shifts the satellite Dirac cones in energy and thus controls when they contribute to the BCD. \n\nWhen comparing the TB and continuum approaches, we find reasonable agreement at strains below roughly 1\\\n\nSeveral questions remain open. We have neglected the Poisson ratio of graphene, treating $_x$ and $_y$ as independent. Incorporating realistic elastic coupling would modify the quantitative predictions. Temperature-dependent effects or disorder scattering also warrant investigation. Nonetheless, the present results establish that realistic TB modeling is essential for reliable predictions of strain-tuned BC phenomena in bilayer graphene.\n\n\n\n\n",

However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al.

Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet.

        "introduction": "Computer simulations of materials  are among the dominant applications of scientific high-performance computing. A major focus of computational materials science is relating atomic arrangements at the nanometre length scale to bulk material properties observed on centimeter scales and beyond. Bridging these roughly seven orders of magnitude in length is essential for understanding how impurities, mixtures, or manufacturing-related defects influence material behaviour on length scales relevant to everyday life.\n\nUnfortunately, atomistic simulations are severely constrained in size by their computational demands. To put the challenge in perspective, a perfect graphene sheet of 1 cm² manufactured in a laboratory via chemical vapour deposition would contain approximately 3.8 quadrillion carbon atoms. Simulating classically the vibrational dynamics of such a sheet with atomic resolution would require storing six double-precision values per atom to track coordinates and velocities in 3D space—amounting to roughly 180 petabytes of memory. This figure is more than thirty times greater than the total system memory available on El Capitan, the most powerful supercomputer currently in operation. \n\nAt the same time, quantum computing aims to revolutionize the computational landscape by providing efficient algorithms for previously intractable problems . Quantum hardware has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years , with fault-tolerant quantum computers anticipated by 2030.

Our algorithm was based on the novel algorithm designed by Babbush et al. , in which the authors proved that the dynamics of a system of coupled classical oscillators can be simulated exponentially faster on a quantum computer.\n\nHowever, the question of whether this algorithm can be used for real-world applications remained open. The main reason is that their framework is constrained by several assumptions. Specifically, they assume that certain operations (oracles) can be constructed (and implemented) efficiently, that the system is sparsely connected, and finally that the number of arbitrary non-zero initial conditions is bounded by $( N)$, where $N$ is the system size.\n\nThe main inspiration for our work has been elastic network models (ENMs) which are widely used for simulating the slow dynamics (and conformational changes) of large molecules. In this framework, the complex interactions between atoms of molecular systems are replaced by harmonic interactions, provided that the distance of two atoms is within a threshold $R_c$. As such, ENMs provide a coarse-grained description of the potential energy surface, simplifying the molecular topology into a network of nodes and springs\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose the quantum elastic network models that allows us to map the classical ENM system onto a quantum mechanical system whose dynamics are governed by the Schrödinger equation. We show that all the building blocks (quantum oracles) can be constructed efficiently for these models, provided that the molecules exhibit an inherent structure. Moreover, we provide a methodology to initialize the system similarly to a standard molecular dynamics simulation.

The performance of these devices is fundamentally governed by the atomic-scale behavior of their electrode and electrolyte materials. Although thermodynamics dictates the open-circuit voltage and theoretical capacity of battery materials, it is kinetics, including ion transport within bulk phases and across interfaces, phase boundary dynamics, and electrochemical reactions, that ultimately determines practical power density and operational lifetime. Understanding and predicting these kinetic phenomena is therefore essential for overcoming the rate-limiting steps that currently constrain the development of high-performance battery chemistries.\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) has long served as the computational foundation for investigating battery kinetics at the atomic scale. However, its substantial computational cost restricts simulations to relatively small system sizes and short timescales, creating a fundamental ``scale gap\" that prevents effective sampling of the complex diffusion networks governing ion transport in realistic battery materials. This limitation has driven an urgent demand for computational approaches that achieve DFT-level accuracy while enabling large-scale screening and comprehensive kinetic modeling.\n\nRecent advances in machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a robust strategy to bridge this gap, offering near-quantum accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost. Specifically, universal MLIPs (uMLIPs), trained on vast datasets spanning the periodic table, have emerged as viable general-purpose surrogates for DFT.

        "introduction": "Molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) provide a compact way of describing how a molecule interacts electrostatically with its environment. MEPs have long been used to rationalize sites of electrophilic and nucleophilic attack, hydrogen bonding patterns, molecular recognition, (electro)catalytic reactivity and solvent design~. Nevertheless, one rarely works directly with continuous MEPs in practical molecular  simulations. Instead, the potential is represented in terms of a set of atomic charges that are tuned to reproduce the  electrostatic potential (ESP) around the molecule as faithfully as possible~.\n\nThis idea gave rise to the “ESP-charge” family of methods, in which atom-centered monopoles are obtained by fitting the quantum-chemical MEP on a grid of points surrounding the molecule. Well-known examples include the Merz–Kollman scheme~, CHELP/CHELPG~, and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model~. These methods differ mainly in how the grid points are chosen, how rotational invariance and numerical stability are enforced, and how regularization or restraints are applied to avoid unphysical charges for highly buried atoms.\n\nOne such regularization is to supplement the ESP fit with constraints that enforce the correct multipole moments~. This improves the description of the far-field electrostatics and helps stabilize the fit for flexible or highly polar molecules. A different but related avenue is exemplified by charge model 5 (CM5)~, which starts from Hirshfeld population analysis and then maps the resulting atomic charges through element- and environment-specific corrections that are parametrized to reproduce gas-phase dipole moments across a large and diverse training set.\n\nIn parallel with these developments, atomistic machine-learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a powerful way to construct environment-dependent charge models.

Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian.

Enforcing the symmetries of the underlying electronic Hamiltonian ensures that predicted energies, forces, and response functions remain physically consistent, while favorable scaling is crucial for accessing the large system sizes needed to capture emergent behavior.

Their high computational cost, however, has motivated extensive efforts to develop accelerated alternatives. A promising approach is the use of machine-learning-based simulators that allow for substantially larger time steps than conventional MD. Among these, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been found to be especially attractive given that they naturally encode the inductive bias of interacting particle systems, however current architectures remain limited in accuracy and stability. In particular, standard message-passing schemes struggle to efficiently propagate long-range information. Here, we investigate whether spectral-GNN simulators can overcome these limitations by explicitly representing a simulated system in a global eigenmode basis, and therefore better capture long-range and collective behavior. Focusing on disordered elastic networks, model systems for complex materials and biological structures such as proteins, we compare spatial, linear spectral, and nonlinear spectral GNN architectures. We find that while spectral representations alone are not sufficient, nonlinear spectral models substantially outperform alternatives.

This poses a major challenge in domains where data generation is expensive or in data-scarce settings. Furthermore, these models typically struggle to extrapolate beyond their training domain. One potential strategy to mitigate these limitations is to train on dynamical data from the domain of interest.    \n\nData of this kind are often available from simulations and, in some cases, from experiments that resolve dynamical behavior. The key idea is to train ML models to detect recurring motifs in system dynamics, enabling them to learn physical principles that are not captured by static structures or coarse global features.
