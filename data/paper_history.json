        "title": "Are Universal Potentials Ready for Alkali-Ion Battery Kinetics?",
        "abstract": "Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy. These findings establish that modern uMLIPs are sufficiently robust to serve as zero-shot surrogates for high-throughput kinetic screening of next-generation energy storage materials.",

        "introduction": "Alkali-ion batteries (AIBs) are central to the sustainable energy transition, with applications spanning portable electronics to grid-scale storage. The performance of these devices is fundamentally governed by the atomic-scale behavior of their electrode and electrolyte materials. Although thermodynamics dictates the open-circuit voltage and theoretical capacity of battery materials, it is kinetics, including ion transport within bulk phases and across interfaces, phase boundary dynamics, and electrochemical reactions, that ultimately determines practical power density and operational lifetime. Understanding and predicting these kinetic phenomena is therefore essential for overcoming the rate-limiting steps that currently constrain the development of high-performance battery chemistries.\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) has long served as the computational foundation for investigating battery kinetics at the atomic scale. However, its substantial computational cost restricts simulations to relatively small system sizes and short timescales, creating a fundamental ``scale gap\" that prevents effective sampling of the complex diffusion networks governing ion transport in realistic battery materials. This limitation has driven an urgent demand for computational approaches that achieve DFT-level accuracy while enabling large-scale screening and comprehensive kinetic modeling.\n\nRecent advances in machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a robust strategy to bridge this gap, offering near-quantum accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost. Specifically, universal MLIPs (uMLIPs), trained on vast datasets spanning the periodic table, have emerged as viable general-purpose surrogates for DFT. The predictive fidelity of uMLIPs for both thermodynamic properties (e.g., formation energies) and dynamic properties (e.g., phonon spectra) has seen remarkable improvement. As illustrated in Figure 1, this progress is driven by the co-evolution of model architectur",

        "title": "Predictive autoencoder-transformer model of Cu oxidation state from EELS and XAS spectra",
        "abstract": "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) produce detailed information about oxidation state, bonding, and coordination, making them essential for quantitative studies of redox and structure in functional materials. However, high-throughput quantitative analysis of these spectra, especially for mixed valence materials, remains challenging as diverse experimental conditions introduce noise, misalignment, broadening of the spectral features. We address this challenge by training a machine learning model consisting of an autoencoder to standardize the spectra and a transformer model to predict both Cu oxidation state and Bader charge directly from L-edge spectra. The model is trained on a large dataset of FEFF-simulated spectra and evaluates model performance on both simulated and experimental data. The results of the machine learning model exhibit highly accurate prediction across the domains of simulated and experimental XAS as well as experimental EELS. These advances enable future quantitative analysis of Cu redox processes under in situ and operando conditions.",

        "abstract": "The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.",

        "introduction": "Molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) provide a compact way of describing how a molecule interacts electrostatically with its environment. MEPs have long been used to rationalize sites of electrophilic and nucleophilic attack, hydrogen bonding patterns, molecular recognition, (electro)catalytic reactivity and solvent design~. Nevertheless, one rarely works directly with continuous MEPs in practical molecular  simulations. Instead, the potential is represented in terms of a set of atomic charges that are tuned to reproduce the  electrostatic potential (ESP) around the molecule as faithfully as possible~.\n\nThis idea gave rise to the “ESP-charge” family of methods, in which atom-centered monopoles are obtained by fitting the quantum-chemical MEP on a grid of points surrounding the molecule. Well-known examples include the Merz–Kollman scheme~, CHELP/CHELPG~, and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model~. These methods differ mainly in how the grid points are chosen, how rotational invariance and numerical stability are enforced, and how regularization or restraints are applied to avoid unphysical charges for highly buried atoms.\n\nOne such regularization is to supplement the ESP fit with constraints that enforce the correct multipole moments~. This improves the description of the far-field electrostatics and helps stabilize the fit for flexible or highly polar molecules. A different but related avenue is exemplified by charge model 5 (CM5)~, which starts from Hirshfeld population analysis and then maps the resulting atomic charges through element- and environment-specific corrections that are parametrized to reproduce gas-phase dipole moments across a large and diverse training set.\n\nIn parallel with these developments, atomistic machine-learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a powerful way to construct environment-dependent charge models. A prominent example is the work by Sifain and co-workers~, who trained a deep neural network to assign atomic charg",
