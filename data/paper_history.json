        "abstract": "In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.",

        "title": "Dynamically training machine-learning-based force fields for strongly anharmonic materials",
        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.",

Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage.

To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF).

        "abstract": "Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.",

Recently, we have constructed long short-term memory (LSTM) networks as a propagator for electronic subsystems in FSSH dynamics simulations. The collective results on Tully's three models have been reproduced satisfactorily. In the present work, we develop an extended LSTM-FSSH framework to simulate realistic photochemical reactions. The input features of LSTM as well as the training procedure are redesigned to represent high-dimensional nuclear degrees of freedom in an effective way. Equivariant neural networks are integrated with LSTM to build adiabatic potential energy surfaces in ground and excited states. Photoisomerizations of $\\mathrm{CH_2NH}$ and azobenzene are simulated, showing that our new proposed LSTM-FSSH method can produce excited-state lifetimes and product yields accurately in comparison with conventional FSSH simulations as reference. Only 10 reference trajectories are required for training LSTM networks, and then a trajectory ensemble can be generated with very efficient LSTM-FSSH dynamics simulations to obtain collective results.",

        "introduction": "Classical molecular dynamics simulations cannot study photochemical reactions because the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is no longer applicable in these cases. Fully quantum treatment on both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom is too computationally expensive for realistic molecular systems, if not impossible. Mixed quantum classical molecular dynamics (MQC-MD) method, including Ehrenfest mean-field (EMF), surface hopping and ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS), provides a powerful tool to chemists. One of the most popular MQC-MD algorithms is the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) developed by Tully in 1990. During FSSH dynamic simulations, the nuclei move classically on an adiabatic potential energy surface (PES) with a certain probability of jumping to any other state. The transition probability is obtained based on the time evolution of electron density matrix, which incorporates quantum feedback of electronic motion. Despite its simple implementation and great success in many applications, the computational expense of FSSH remains much higher than that of ground-state MD. Not only the potential energies and gradients for all relevant electronic states but also the nonadiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs) between different states should be calculated at a high level of electronic structure theory in each time step. Furthermore, FSSH requires an ensemble of trajectories to estimate collective results such as the excited-state lifetime and product yield. Strictly speaking, a dozen FSSH trajectories make little sense for revealing any mechanism of medium-sized or larger polyatomic molecules.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating machine learning (ML) techniques with MQC-MD for accelerating nonadiabatic dynamic simulations. ML has demonstrated its strong capability of fitting potential energy surfaces of high-dimensional molecules, either in the ground or excited state. However, accurate predictions of NACVs are much more difficu",

However, state-of-the-art trajectory analysis methods infer bonding from instantaneous distance thresholds, which can misclassify transient, nonreactive encounters as bonds and thereby introduce spurious intermediates, distorted reaction networks, and biased rate estimates. Here, we introduce ChemXDyn, a dynamics-aware computational methodology that leverages time-resolved interatomic distance signatures as a core principle to robustly identify chemically consistent bonded interactions and, consequently, extract meaningful reaction pathways. In particular, ChemXDyn propagates molecular connectivity through time while enforcing atomic valence and coordination constraints to distinguish genuine bond-breaking and bond-forming events from transient, nonreactive encounters. We evaluate ChemXDyn on ReaxFF MD simulations of hydrogen and ammonia oxidation and on neural-network potential MD simulations of methane oxidation, and benchmark its performance against widely used trajectory analysis methods. Across these cases, ChemXDyn suppresses unphysical species prevalent in static analyses, recovers experimentally consistent reaction pathways, and improves the fidelity of rate constant estimation. In ammonia oxidation, ChemXDyn removes unphysical intermediates and resolves key NOx- and N2O-forming and -consuming routes. In methane oxidation, it reconstructs the canonical progression from CH4 to CO2. By linking atomistic dynamics to chemically consistent reaction identification, ChemXDyn provides a transferable foundation for MD-derived reaction networks and kinetics, with potential utility spanning combustion, catalysis, plasma chemistry, and electrochemical environments.",

Although recent machine-learning models achieve near chemical accuracy in the prediction of TS structures and the associated reaction barriers for small organic reactions, their ability to generalize beyond the training domain remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce targeted benchmarks to probe chemical and structural novelty in generative TS prediction. Building on Transition1x, a large-scale dataset of reactions involving small organic molecules, we construct curated extensions incorporating controlled elemental substitutions and diverse transition-metal complexes (TMC). These benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations of generative models in the generalization to previously unseen elements. As a result, they produce unphysical geometries and large energetic errors, even for reactions structurally similar to well-predicted organic systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on equilibrium conformers that exposes generative TS models to novel chemical environments prior to targeted fine-tuning. Across the newly proposed benchmarks, self-supervised pretraining substantially improves TS prediction for previously unseen systems, lowering the median RMSD of TS geometries on T1x-TMC reactions from 0.39 to 0.19 $\\mathring{A}$ and reducing fine-tuning data requirements by up to 75%, enabling reliable performance even in low-data regimes. Overall, the integration of generative TS models with self-supervised pseudo-reaction pretraining provides an efficient, scalable, and chemically robust framework for elucidating TSs well beyond the small organic molecule domain, establishing a foundation for investigating complex and catalytically relevant reaction landscapes.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \\textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \\ce{Ti}, \\ce{Zr}, and \\ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \\ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.",

        "introduction": "The challenges associated with developing, manipulating, and understanding nanoscale atomistic systems have drawn significant attention from the research community due to fast advances in nanoscience. In the subnanometer regime, where quantum size effects become dominant, the nanostructures made of a few tens to several hundred atoms often show properties that differ from those of their bulk crystalline counterparts. This emergent behavior enables the materials design with tunable structural and electronic features, offering many opportunities in the energy conversion, optoelectronic, and catalytic fields. Transition metal (TM) nanoclusters (NCs) stand out in this context because of their distinct chemical reactivity, discrete electronic states, and high surface/volume ratios. The intrinsic fluxionality, finite size, and lack of translational symmetry characteristics result in a broad configurational landscape with many non-equivalent adsorption sites. As a result, TM-NCs exhibit a complex, yet highly adaptable catalytic behavior, which is particularly important in real-world scenarios (realistic environmental conditions) where toxic poisoning species and/or competing reaction pathways may be present.\n\nThe catalytic deactivation caused by -containing species is a long-standing dilemma in heterogeneous catalysis. This challenge arises because sulfur atoms and sulfur-bearing molecules, such as , , and , show strong affinity for metal active sites, frequently leading to partial or complete catalytic activity loss. Although adsorption mechanisms on extended surfaces are reasonably well disseminated/understood, the behavior of  adsorption on subnanometer clusters remains far less explored. This knowledge gap is mainly due to pronounced finite-size effects, enhanced fluxionality, and the low coordination of surface atoms in TM-NCs. Consequently, developing robust nanocatalysts requires a fundamental understanding of --NC interactions at the atomistic scale.\n\nIn TM-NCs, re",

To address this issue, we develop GPUTB-2, a framework that learns implicitly orthogonality-preserving Hamiltonians by training directly on electronic band structures. Benefiting from an E(3)-equivariant network accelerated by Gaunt tensor product and SO(2) tensor product layers, GPUTB-2 achieves significantly higher accuracy than GPUTB across multiple benchmark systems. Moreover, GPUTB-2 accurately predicts large-scale electronic structures, including transport properties of temperature-perturbed SnSe and the band structures of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.

        "introduction": "Density functional theory (DFT) has established itself as an indispensable tool in heterogeneous catalysis, providing quantitative links between atomic structure, adsorption thermodynamics, and catalytic activity. However, practical catalysis studies are rarely reducible to single calculations. Even standard tasks such as determining surface energies or screening descriptors often require orchestrating multi-step workflows: selecting bulk references, constructing and relaxing slabs under consistent constraints, enumerating adsorption sites, and managing job submission queues.\n\nWhile the community has developed robust libraries for atomistic simulations (e.g., ASE, pymatgen) and workflow managers for job orchestration, a significant operational gap around the practical use of these libraries persists. Consequently, researchers still frequently rely on manual intervention to chain disparate tools, convert data formats, and track intermediate structures. This manual oversight requires too many micro-decisions: managing calculation files, adjusting convergence parameters, diagnosing failures, or selecting candidates for high-fidelity validation. This overhead may slow iteration and complicate the exploration of vast chemical spaces.\n\nLarge language model (LLM) agents offer a compelling interface for such workflows, enabling researchers to express protocol intent in natural language while the agent coordinates the underlying tools. Recent efforts in chemistry and materials science have demonstrated the feasibility of LLM-driven automation. For rigorous catalysis research, however, three requirements are particularly important: (i) , ensuring the generation of inspectable artifacts (inputs, logs, reports); (ii) , enabling reliable local project resumption following interruptions while supporting execution on remote HPC systems; and (iii) , enabling the traceability of intermediate decisions for the long-running project.\n\nCatMaster addresses these needs by treating the cal",

        "introduction": "Recently, significant attention has been given to anomalous Hall effects in graphene and other two-dimensional materials , . Unlike the conventional Hall effect, which requires an external magnetic field, these effects arise from the non-zero Berry curvature (BC) of the electronic bands, which acts as an effective magnetic field in momentum space . Two types of anomalous Hall responses are linked to non-zero Berry curvature: linear and nonlinear responses. The linear anomalous Hall current is proportional to the Berry curvature, whereas the nonlinear effect is linked to the presence of a non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole (BCD) . In 2021, both linear and nonlinear Hall effect currents were observed in corrugated bilayer graphene , whereas previously such responses had only been observed in the Weyl semi-metal WTe$_2$ . While the BCD in pristine bilayer graphene vanishes, the nonlinear Hall effect can emerge when inversion symmetry is broken and the Dirac cones are tilted by corrugation or strain.\n\nThe anomalous Hall effect can be studied theoretically through simulations of the full electrical response, but such approaches are computationally intensive. A more amenable approach for homogeneous systems is to relate the BC and the BCD to the properties of the Bloch wave functions in k-space. These can be obtained by direct diagonalization of the system's Hamiltonian. Previous work, such as Ref. , found that a non-vanishing BCD appears in uniaxially strained bilayer graphene as a consequence of Fermi surface warping. In that work, the BC and BCD were calculated using an effective low-energy continuum Hamiltonian, in which strain effects enters as an strain-induced gauge potential.\n\nA different approach based on a tight-binding (TB) model can be used to calculate the energy dispersion and wave functions of the material. Importantly, the TB model of bilayer graphene offers some advantages over continuum models, especially when it comes to studying the effects of lattic",
        "conclusion": "The BCD in strained bilayer graphene proves sensitive to details of the electronic structure that are often treated as secondary. Our TB calculations reveal that the choice between  bilayer graphene versus bulk graphite parameters leads to qualitatively different predictions for the BCD as a function of doping, particularly sign changes that occur at experimentally accessible carrier densities. We find that this difference arises from the $_4$ skew hopping, which shifts the satellite Dirac cones in energy and thus controls when they contribute to the BCD. \n\nWhen comparing the TB and continuum approaches, we find reasonable agreement at strains below roughly 1\\\n\nSeveral questions remain open. We have neglected the Poisson ratio of graphene, treating $_x$ and $_y$ as independent. Incorporating realistic elastic coupling would modify the quantitative predictions. Temperature-dependent effects or disorder scattering also warrant investigation. Nonetheless, the present results establish that realistic TB modeling is essential for reliable predictions of strain-tuned BC phenomena in bilayer graphene.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "introduction": "Computer simulations of materials  are among the dominant applications of scientific high-performance computing. A major focus of computational materials science is relating atomic arrangements at the nanometre length scale to bulk material properties observed on centimeter scales and beyond. Bridging these roughly seven orders of magnitude in length is essential for understanding how impurities, mixtures, or manufacturing-related defects influence material behaviour on length scales relevant to everyday life.\n\nUnfortunately, atomistic simulations are severely constrained in size by their computational demands. To put the challenge in perspective, a perfect graphene sheet of 1 cm² manufactured in a laboratory via chemical vapour deposition would contain approximately 3.8 quadrillion carbon atoms. Simulating classically the vibrational dynamics of such a sheet with atomic resolution would require storing six double-precision values per atom to track coordinates and velocities in 3D space—amounting to roughly 180 petabytes of memory. This figure is more than thirty times greater than the total system memory available on El Capitan, the most powerful supercomputer currently in operation. \n\nAt the same time, quantum computing aims to revolutionize the computational landscape by providing efficient algorithms for previously intractable problems . Quantum hardware has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years , with fault-tolerant quantum computers anticipated by 2030.

Our algorithm was based on the novel algorithm designed by Babbush et al. , in which the authors proved that the dynamics of a system of coupled classical oscillators can be simulated exponentially faster on a quantum computer.\n\nHowever, the question of whether this algorithm can be used for real-world applications remained open. The main reason is that their framework is constrained by several assumptions. Specifically, they assume that certain operations (oracles) can be constructed (and implemented) efficiently, that the system is sparsely connected, and finally that the number of arbitrary non-zero initial conditions is bounded by $( N)$, where $N$ is the system size.\n\nThe main inspiration for our work has been elastic network models (ENMs) which are widely used for simulating the slow dynamics (and conformational changes) of large molecules. In this framework, the complex interactions between atoms of molecular systems are replaced by harmonic interactions, provided that the distance of two atoms is within a threshold $R_c$. As such, ENMs provide a coarse-grained description of the potential energy surface, simplifying the molecular topology into a network of nodes and springs\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose the quantum elastic network models that allows us to map the classical ENM system onto a quantum mechanical system whose dynamics are governed by the Schrödinger equation. We show that all the building blocks (quantum oracles) can be constructed efficiently for these models, provided that the molecules exhibit an inherent structure.

        "abstract": "Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy.

        "introduction": "Alkali-ion batteries (AIBs) are central to the sustainable energy transition, with applications spanning portable electronics to grid-scale storage. The performance of these devices is fundamentally governed by the atomic-scale behavior of their electrode and electrolyte materials. Although thermodynamics dictates the open-circuit voltage and theoretical capacity of battery materials, it is kinetics, including ion transport within bulk phases and across interfaces, phase boundary dynamics, and electrochemical reactions, that ultimately determines practical power density and operational lifetime. Understanding and predicting these kinetic phenomena is therefore essential for overcoming the rate-limiting steps that currently constrain the development of high-performance battery chemistries.\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) has long served as the computational foundation for investigating battery kinetics at the atomic scale. However, its substantial computational cost restricts simulations to relatively small system sizes and short timescales, creating a fundamental ``scale gap\" that prevents effective sampling of the complex diffusion networks governing ion transport in realistic battery materials. This limitation has driven an urgent demand for computational approaches that achieve DFT-level accuracy while enabling large-scale screening and comprehensive kinetic modeling.\n\nRecent advances in machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a robust strategy to bridge this gap, offering near-quantum accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost. Specifically, universal MLIPs (uMLIPs), trained on vast datasets spanning the periodic table, have emerged as viable general-purpose surrogates for DFT. The predictive fidelity of uMLIPs for both thermodynamic properties (e.g., formation energies) and dynamic properties (e.g., phonon spectra) has seen remarkable improvement.

        "introduction": "Molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) provide a compact way of describing how a molecule interacts electrostatically with its environment. MEPs have long been used to rationalize sites of electrophilic and nucleophilic attack, hydrogen bonding patterns, molecular recognition, (electro)catalytic reactivity and solvent design~. Nevertheless, one rarely works directly with continuous MEPs in practical molecular  simulations. Instead, the potential is represented in terms of a set of atomic charges that are tuned to reproduce the  electrostatic potential (ESP) around the molecule as faithfully as possible~.\n\nThis idea gave rise to the “ESP-charge” family of methods, in which atom-centered monopoles are obtained by fitting the quantum-chemical MEP on a grid of points surrounding the molecule. Well-known examples include the Merz–Kollman scheme~, CHELP/CHELPG~, and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model~. These methods differ mainly in how the grid points are chosen, how rotational invariance and numerical stability are enforced, and how regularization or restraints are applied to avoid unphysical charges for highly buried atoms.\n\nOne such regularization is to supplement the ESP fit with constraints that enforce the correct multipole moments~. This improves the description of the far-field electrostatics and helps stabilize the fit for flexible or highly polar molecules. A different but related avenue is exemplified by charge model 5 (CM5)~, which starts from Hirshfeld population analysis and then maps the resulting atomic charges through element- and environment-specific corrections that are parametrized to reproduce gas-phase dipole moments across a large and diverse training set.\n\nIn parallel with these developments, atomistic machine-learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a powerful way to construct environment-dependent charge models.

The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally.

        "abstract": "Implicit solvent models (ISMs) promise to deliver the accuracy of explicit solvent simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, despite decades of development, their accuracy has remained insufficient for many critical applications, particularly for simulating protein folding and the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. Developing a transferable, data-driven ISM that overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical formulas remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy that distills the evolutionary information learned by a protein language model, ESM3, into a computationally efficient graph neural network (GNN). We show that this GNN potential, trained on effective energies from ESM3, is robust enough to drive stable, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. When combined with a standard electrostatics term, our hybrid model accurately reproduces protein folding free-energy landscapes and predicts the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. This approach yields a single, unified model that is transferable across both folded and disordered protein states, resolving a long-standing limitation of conventional ISMs. By successfully distilling evolutionary knowledge into a physical potential, our work delivers a foundational implicit solvent model poised to accelerate the development of predictive, large-scale simulation tools.",

        "abstract": "Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.",

        "introduction": "\n\nMachine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool in atomistic simulation, offering near–quantum-mechanical accuracy at dramatically reduced computational cost~. By learning high-dimensional potential energy surfaces from density functional theory (DFT) or other electronic-structure methods, ML models extend molecular dynamics (MD) simulations far beyond what is feasible with direct { ab initio} calculations~. These data-driven force fields now enable predictive modeling across catalysis, energy materials, biomolecules, and complex condensed-matter systems, delivering first-principles fidelity at computational speeds comparable to empirical potentials.\n\nTwo key requirements for ML force-field models are computational scalability and faithful preservation of physical symmetries. Enforcing the symmetries of the underlying electronic Hamiltonian ensures that predicted energies, forces, and response functions remain physically consistent, while favorable scaling is crucial for accessing the large system sizes needed to capture emergent behavior. These principles were exemplified in the pioneering work of Behler and Parrinello~, which express the total energy as $E=_i _i$, with each local contribution $_i$ encoded through symmetry-invariant descriptors of the atomic environment. When paired with expressive neural networks, these descriptors yield accurate local energy models whose forces follow from energy gradients, establishing a widely used paradigm for constructing efficient, symmetry-respecting ML interatomic potentials.\n\nIn descriptor-based ML models, symmetry is enforced entirely through feature design. For molecular and atomic systems, descriptors must respect the Euclidean symmetry group $E(3)$---translations, rotations, and reflections---as well as atomic permutations.

        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a central tool in science and engineering enabling the study of dynamical behavior and the link between microscopic structure and macroscopic function. Their high computational cost, however, has motivated extensive efforts to develop accelerated alternatives. A promising approach is the use of machine-learning-based simulators that allow for substantially larger time steps than conventional MD. Among these, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been found to be especially attractive given that they naturally encode the inductive bias of interacting particle systems, however current architectures remain limited in accuracy and stability. In particular, standard message-passing schemes struggle to efficiently propagate long-range information. Here, we investigate whether spectral-GNN simulators can overcome these limitations by explicitly representing a simulated system in a global eigenmode basis, and therefore better capture long-range and collective behavior. Focusing on disordered elastic networks, model systems for complex materials and biological structures such as proteins, we compare spatial, linear spectral, and nonlinear spectral GNN architectures. We find that while spectral representations alone are not sufficient, nonlinear spectral models substantially outperform alternatives. By learning both the time-dependent dynamics and the mixing of eigenmodes, these models more accurately capture the system's slow, global modes, which dominate macroscopic behavior. This leads to a marked reduction in systematic particle-position error and significantly improved prediction of global physical properties.",

        "introduction": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen rapid growth across the physical sciences and engineering in recent years. Machine learning (ML) and AI related techniques have proven effective in diverse tasks such as force-field development, enhanced sampling,structure prediction, and inverse design. However, the performance of ML models is often strongly dependent on the availability of large, high-quality datasets. This poses a major challenge in domains where data generation is expensive or in data-scarce settings. Furthermore, these models typically struggle to extrapolate beyond their training domain. One potential strategy to mitigate these limitations is to train on dynamical data from the domain of interest.    \n\nData of this kind are often available from simulations and, in some cases, from experiments that resolve dynamical behavior. The key idea is to train ML models to detect recurring motifs in system dynamics, enabling them to learn physical principles that are not captured by static structures or coarse global features. By leveraging these dynamical regularities, such models can be far more sample-efficient, cutting down the number of systems required for training. Consequently, the overall need for data from costly sources such as experiments,  computations, or long-timescale simulations can be greatly reduced. \n\nIn this context, neural network simulators (NNS) that predict the time-dependent behavior of a system using a set of input descriptors, are an attractive choice due to their ability to capture and generalize the dynamics of complex systems.  As traditional simulators, those that repeatedly solve Newton’s second law, including ones that rely on machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), are often computationally expensive, NNSs offer a compelling alternative because they can propagate trajectories with step sizes that are approximately 10–1000 times larger than standard MD time steps. NNSs can significantly reduce computational",
